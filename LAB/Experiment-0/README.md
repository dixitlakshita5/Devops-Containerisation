# Devops-Containerisation

## Experiment 0 

### WSL Installation

Mac users do not require to install **WSL** on their system as they can directly use docker through their terminal, hence this experiment is skipped.

### Docker Installation

1. Install Docker Desktop for Mac,
Docker Desktop was downloaded and installed from the official Docker website.<br>
Since macOS supports Docker natively, WSL is not required.
