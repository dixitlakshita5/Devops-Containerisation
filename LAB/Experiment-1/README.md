# Devops-Containerisation

## Experiment 1

Comparison of Virtual Machines (VMs) and Containers using Ubuntu and Nginx

#### _NOTE_

This experiment is performed on a **MAC OS** system - _Apple Silcon M2_

### Objective 

To understand the conceptual and practical differences between Virtual Machines and Containers.

1. To install and configure a Virtual Machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant on Windows.
2. To install and configure Containers using Docker Desktop on macOS.
3. To deploy an Ubuntu-based Nginx web server in both environments.
4. To compare resource utilization, performance, and operational characteristics of VMs and Containers.

### Steps - _All the Steps are for Mac Users_

1. Install Docker Desktop for Mac,
