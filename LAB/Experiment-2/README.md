# EXPERIMENT – 2  
## Docker Installation, Configuration, and Running Images

---

## Aim

To install and configure Docker, pull Docker images, run containers, and manage the container lifecycle using Docker commands.

---
![](./images/)
## Objectives

- To pull Docker images from Docker Hub  
- To run containers with port mapping  
- To verify running containers  
- To manage container lifecycle (start, stop, remove)

---

## Theory

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows applications to be packaged along with their dependencies into lightweight and portable containers.

A **Docker Image** is a read-only template used to create containers.  
A **Docker Container** is a running instance of a Docker image.

Docker follows a **client–server architecture**, where:
- The Docker Client sends commands  
- The Docker Daemon executes those commands  
- Docker Hub stores public images  

Containers are lightweight because they share the host operating system kernel, unlike traditional Virtual Machines which require a separate operating system.
